            Takashi Murakami (村上 隆) was born February 1, 1962 in Tokyo Japan. He is a contemporary artist who works in fine arts media such as painting as sculpture, as well as commercial media including fashion, merchandise, and animation. His greatest contribution to modern art is blurring lines between high and low arts. He coined the term "superflat", which describes both the aesthetic characteristics of the Japanese artistic tradition and the nature of postwar Japanese culture and society, and is also used for Murakami's artistic style and other Japanese artists he has influenced.
